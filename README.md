# Getting and Cleaning Data - Final Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.

From the course requirements page:

1. You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

6. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


# Important File locations:

1.  run_analysis.R can be found in the /R folder.
2.  The final tidy dataset can be found in the /data/tidy folder.  The output file name is:  tidy_dataset.txt
3.  The code book for the tidy dataset can be found in the /refs folder.  The code book is called:  project_code_book.md
